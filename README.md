## Tested on

The main device on which the application is being tested: **MSI Summit E16 Flip Evo A12MT**

[List of tested devices](/docs/tested_devices.md)


## Installation

The application requires the `ec_sys` module with option `write_support=1` to run.

If the `ec_sys` kernel module is not included in your distribution's kernel, you can use the `acpi_ec` kernel module.

This is QT application. You may need to install `libqt5widgets5` to run.

## Localization

You can help translate the MControlCenter app into your native language

1. Copy `/src/i18n/MControlCenter_en.ts` to `src/i18n/MControlCenter_xx.ts` where xx is language code into which the translation is being made.
2. Open `MControlCenter_xx.ts` in text editor and change `language="en_US"` to your language code.
3. Translate strings into your language directly in a text editor or use the QT Linguist app.
4. Translate `GenericName` in app shortcut `resources/mcontrolcenter.desktop`. To do this, add the line `GenericName[xx]=translated generic name`.
5. Send pull request on github.
